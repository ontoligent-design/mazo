# Mazo
Mazo is a simple inteface to [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php), built on top of [Polite](https://github.com/ontoligent/polite), which is a lite version of [Polo](https://github.com/ontoligent-design/polo2). Mazo is "mallet" in Spanish and is pronounced `/MA-so/`.

## Instructions

Mazo expects `mallet` to be in your PATH environment variable. If it is not, you'll need to edit the `config.ini` file. For example, if you are using Windows and followed [the installation instructions](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php) for MALLET on the website, you'd change the value of `mallet_path` to `bin\mallet`, like so:

```
[DEFAULT]
mallet_path = bin\mallet
``` 

Or, if you want to point to the specific location of `mallet`, you can do something like this:

```
[DEFAULT]
mallet_path = C:\mallet-2.0.8\bin\mallet
```

or 

```
[DEFAULT]
mallet_path = /opt/mallet/bin/mallet
```

Now, to begin using Mazo, you'll need to first put [a MALLET compliant corpus file](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/import.php) in the corpus directory and name it in a special way:

```
<keyword>-corpus.csv
```

Here, `<keyword>` is a word used to name everything else. For example, the corpus directory contains a sample corpus file called `demo-corpus.csv`; `demo` is the keyword. After mazo runs, everything will be put in an output directory with the word `demo` prefixed to the files and directories.

To run Mazo, do this:

```
python mazo.py <keyword> <k>
```

where `<k>` stands for the number of topics in the model, and `python` is Python 3.*. (Note, if you know how to use `chmod`, you don't need to call Python explicitly.)

To try it out, use the demo file:

```
python mazo.py demo 20
```

After this runs, you should see an `output` directory. There you will find a directory named someting like this:

```buildoutcfg
output/demo-20-1585231796908834
```

That number is just the keyword with the number of tokens and a unix timestamp added to it. It is used to separate your topic models from each other, since each is unique. (You should delete these directories when you done with them.)

Inside of this directory, you will find all the files that MALLET generated, plus a subdirectory called `tables`. In that directory, you should see the following files:

```buildoutcfg
DOC.csv
DOCTOPIC.csv
DOCTOPIC_NARROW.csv
DOCWORD.csv
TOPIC.csv
TOPICPHRASE.csv
TOPICWORD.csv
TOPICWORD_DIAGS.csv
TOPICWORD_NARROW.csv
TOPICWORD_WEIGHTS.csv
VOCAB.csv
```

These files implement a relational data model of the topic model. They can be imported into a relational database (like SQLite) or read directly into Pandas. 

Have fun!
